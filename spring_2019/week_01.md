## Last Week's Accomplishments

 * Nodejs server
 * Mongodb Server
 * Local environments
 * Github
* Assigned myself to first github issue.


## This Week's Plan
* Coordinate with other late members who want to work on potential iOS implementation, given background in iOS development, Xcode and Mac
* Learn proper protocol on when to commit and which files I should and shouldn't push
* Learn basic javascript syntax as well as begin learning web scraping paradigms

## Anything Blocking?
